## Forecasting Gold Prices using Machine Learning
Gold price forecasting plays a crucial role in financial decision-making and investment strategies. In this study, we propose a methodology for forecasting gold prices utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, integrated with the Flask framework for web deployment. 

## About
Forecasting gold prices using machine learning involves using historical data on various factors that influence the price of gold, such as economic indicators, market sentiment, geopolitical events, and supply and demand dynamics, to build predictive models. These models are trained to analyze patterns and relationships within the data and make predictions about future gold prices.

## Features
- Identify patterns​
- Predict future prices
- Inform investment decisions
